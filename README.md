#	WalkEasy An Echo Location Device for visually impaired to mimic bats navigation techniques

-   WalkEasy A Device that mimics Bats and Whales navigation of the environment using A depth Stereo Cameras the device uses a camera to capture the spatial information instead of sound beacons (unlike whales)
-	it constructs a depth map and point cloud of the scene which is then used to feedback spatial tones using HRTF functions to localize objects in the environment on the fly by the visually impaired individual the Stereo Matching algorithm accelerated GPU execution on ARM Mali GPUs of smartphones
-	C++/Java, python, OpenCL, Android Studio, Git, VScode, ESP cams, Free RTOS, Socket Programming, Object Detection
